      "description": "Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) are highly effective in treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) but do not eliminate leukemia stem cells (LSC), which remain a potential source of relapse. TKI treatment effectively inhibits BCR-ABL kinase activity in CML LSC, suggesting that additional kinase-independent mechanisms contribute to LSC preservation. We investigated whether signals from the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment protect CML LSC from TKI treatment. Coculture with human BM mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) significantly inhibited apoptosis and preserved CML stem/progenitor cells following TKI exposure, maintaining colony forming ability and engraftment potential in immunodeficient mice. We found that the N-Cadherin receptor plays an important role in MSC-mediated protection of CML progenitors from TKI. N-Cadherin-mediated adhesion to MSC was associated with increased cytoplasmic N-Cadherin-β-catenin complex formation, as well as enhanced β-catenin nuclear translocation and transcriptional activity. Increased exogenous Wnt-mediated β-catenin signaling played an important role in MSC-mediated protection of CML progenitors from TKI treatment. Our results reveal a close interplay between N-Cadherin and the Wnt-β-catenin pathway in protecting CML LSC during TKI treatment. Importantly, these results reveal novel mechanisms of resistance of CML LSC to TKI treatment, and suggest new targets for treatment designed to eradicate residual LSC in CML patients. RNA was obtained from CML CD34+ cells treated with or without IM (5μM) and MSC for 96 hours, amplified, labeled  and hybridized to GeneChip 1.0 arrays (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). Microarray data analysis was performed using R (version 2.9) with genomic analysis packages from Bioconductor (version 2.4). The 33297 probes represented on the microarray were filtered by cross-sample mean, and for standard deviation of greater than the 25% quantile, yielding 18624 probes representing 12553 genes. Linear regression was used to model the gene expression with the consideration of a 2x2 factorial design and matched samples. Differentially expressed genes were identified by calculating empirical Bayes moderated t-statistic, and p-values were adjusted by FDR using the “LIMMA” package. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) was performed using GSEA software version 2.04 to detect enrichment of predetermined gene sets using t-scores from all genes for 1263 gene sets in the C2 (curated gene sets) category from the Molecular Signature Database (MsigDB).",

      "title": "Gene expression profiling of CD34/CD38 sorted CML cells",
      "description": "BACKGROUND: BCR-ABL1+ chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is characterized by abnormal production of leukemic stem (LSC) and progenitor cells and their spread from the bone marrow into the blood resulting in extramedullary myeloproliferation. So far, little is known about specific markers and functions of LSC in CML. METHODS: We examined the phenotype and function of CD34+/CD38─/Lin─ CML LSC by a multi-parameter screen approach employing antibody-phenotyping, mRNA expression profiling, and functional studies, including LSC repopulation experiments in irradiated NOD-SCID-IL-2Rgamma-/- (NSG) mice, followed by marker-validation using diverse control-cohorts and follow-up samples of CML patients treated with imatinib. RESULTS: Of all LSC markers examined, dipeptidylpeptidase IV (DPPIV=CD26) was identified as specific and functionally relevant surface marker-enzyme on CD34+/CD38─ CML LSC. CD26 was not detected on normal CD34+/CD38─ stem cells or LSC in other hematopoietic malignancies. The percentage of CD26+ CML LSC decreased to undetectable levels during successful treatment with imatinib in all patients (p<0.001). Whereas the sorted CD26─ stem cells obtained from CML patients engrafted irradiated NSG mice with multilineage BCR-ABL1-negative hematopoiesis, CD26+ LSC engrafted NSG mice with BCR-ABL1+ cells. Functionally, CD26 was identified as target-enzyme disrupting the SDF-1alpha-CXCR4-axis by cleaving SDF-1alpha a chemotaxin for CXCR4+ stem cells. Whereas CD26 was found to inhibit SDF-1alpha-induced migration, CD26-targeting gliptins reverted this effect and blocked the mobilization of CML LSC in a stroma co-culture assay. CONCLUSIONS: CD26 is a robust biomarker of LSC and a useful tool for their quantification and isolation in patients with BCR/ABL1+ CML. Moreover, CD26 expression may explain the extramedullary spread of LSC in CML. To define specific mRNA expression patterns and to identify specific LSC markers in CML LSC, gene array analyses were performed. RNA was isolated from sorted CD34+/CD45+/CD38─ CML LSC, CD34+/CD45+/CD38+ CML progenitor cells, CML MNC, sorted CD34+/CD38─ cord blood (CB) SC, CB-derived CD34+/CD38+ progenitor cells, and CB MNC. Total RNA was extracted from sorted cells using RNeasy Micro-Kit (Qiagen) and used (100 ng total RNA) for Gene Chip analyses. Preparation of terminal-labeled cRNA, hybridization to genome-wide human PrimeView GeneChips (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and scanning of arrays were carried out according to the manufacturer's protocols (https://www.affymetrix.com). Robust Multichip Average (RMA) signal extraction and normalization were performed according to http://www.bioconductor.org/ as described.18 Differences in mRNA expression levels (from multiple paired samples) were calculated as mRNA ratio of i) CML LSC versus CB SC, ii) CML LSC versus CD34+/CD38+ CML progenitors, and normal cord blood SC versus cord blood progenitors. To calculate differential gene expression between individual sample groups where appropriate, we performed a statistical comparison using the LIMMA package as described previously. Briefly, LIMMA estimates the fold change between predefined sample groups by fitting a linear model and using an empirical Bayes method to moderate the standard errors of the estimated log-fold changes for each probe set.",

      "description": "We previously demonstrated that Alox5 deficiency impairs the function of LSCs and prevents the initiation of BCR-ABL-induced CML. To identify the pathways in which Alox5 gene regulates function of LSCs, we performed a comparative DNA microarray analysis using total RNA isolated from non-BCR-ABL-expressing Lin-Sca-1+c-Kit+, BCR-ABL-expressing wild type LSCs and BCR-ABL-expressing Alox5-/- LSCs. The result was validated by quantitative real-time PCR analysis of non-BCR-ABL-expressing Lin-Sca-1+c-Kit+, BCR-ABL-expressing wild type LSCs and BCR-ABL-expressing Alox5-/- LSCs. We have shown that Alox5 is a critical regulator of leukemia stem cells (LSCs) in a BCR-ABL-induced chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) mouse model, and we hypothesize that the Alox5 pathway represents a major molecular network that regulates LSC function. Therefore, we sought to further dissect this pathway by comparing the gene expression profiles of wild type and Alox5-/- LSCs derived from our mouse model for BCR-ABL-induced CML. DNA microarray analysis revealed a small group of candidate genes that exhibited changes in the levels of transcription in the absence of Alox5 expression.  In particular, we noted that the expression of the Msr1 gene was up-regulated in Alox5-/- LSCs, suggesting that Msr1 might suppress the proliferation of LSCs.  Using our CML mouse model, we show that Msr1 is down-regulated by BCR-ABL and this down-regulation is partially restored by Alox5 deletion, and that Msr1 deletion causes acceleration of CML development. Moreover, Msr1 deletion markedly increases LSC function through its effects on cell cycle progression and apoptosis. We also show that Msr1 affects CML development by regulating the PI3K-AKT pathway and β-Catenin. Together, these results demonstrate that Msr1 suppresses LSCs and CML development. The enhancement of Msr1 function may be of significance in the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting CML. To identify genes that are regulated by BCR-ABL in LSCs and LSCs without Alox5 gene, we compared the gene profile between wild type(WT) LSCs or Alox5-/- LSCs.",

      "description": "KCL-22 is a chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cell line derived from a patient in blast crisis phase and harbors the BCR-ABL translocation. The catalytic (ATP-competitive) BCR-ABL inhibitors imatinib and nilotinib have dramatically improved CML patient outcome, but the development of resistance remains a clinical challenge. The recent identification of allosteric BCR-ABL inhibitors, such as GNF-2, which target the enzyme by binding to the myristoyl pocket rather than catalytic site of ABL1, may provide a strategy to broadly overcome resistance to the class of ABL1 ATP competitive inhibitors. We therefore wanted to use the ClonTracer barcoding system to compare the clonal responses of KCL-22 to imatinib, nilotinib and GNF-2. RNA-seq was employed to characterize genetic alterations and gene expression signatures in the pooled cell populations resistant to BCR-ABL inhibitors as well as single clones showing differential response to the three inhibitors. mRNA profiling of the subpopulations and single clones of human CML cell line KCL-22 that contribute to BCR-ABL inhibitor resistance",

Inhibition of this Blk pathway accelerates CML development, whereas increased activity of the Blk pathway delays CML development. To identify the pathways in which Blk regulates function of LSCs, we performed a comparative DNA microarray analysis using total RNA isolated from non-BCR-ABL-expressing Lin-Sca-1+c-Kit+, BCR-ABL- and BCR-ABL-Blk expressing LSCs. This analysis revealed a large group of candidate genes that exhibited changes in the levels of transcription in the Blk expressing LSCs, and uncovered the molecular mechanisms by which Blk suppresses LSCs and CML development. Bone marrow cells were transduced with GFP, BCR-ABL-GFP or BCR-ABL-Blk-GFP, followed by transplantation into recipient mice. Fourteen days after transplantation, bone marrow cells were isolated and LSCs were sorted by FACS for isolation of total RNA for DNA microarray analysis.",

Overall design: Fifteen patients with confirmed CML, on IM for a minimum period of 18-months and showing suboptimal response to IM, as evidenced by failure to achieve major molecular remission (MMolR) at 18 months were identified from a series of patients treated in our centre. Patients received their medication under the auspices of the Glivec International Patient Assistance Program (GIPAP) and were started on an initial dose of 400mg with dose escalations or reductions made according to the patient’s response and tolerance. Archived sequential peripheral blood lysates from the patients were retrieved and DNA/RNA extracted. Thirty-nine DNA samples of sufficient quality and quantity from the 15 patients were subjected to array-CGH analysis to identify recurrent genomic aberrations that occur through the course of disease.",

      "description": "In chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) neoplastic stem cells (NCS) represent a critical target of therapy. However, little is known about markers and targets expressed in CML NSC. We examined the phenotype and function of CD34+/CD38─/Lin─ CML LSC by a multi-parameter screen approach employing antibody-phenotyping, mRNA expression profiling, and functional studies, followed by marker-validation using diverse control-cohorts and follow-up samples of CML patients treated with imatinib. We here show that in contrast to normal stem cells, CD34+/CD38− CML NSC express IL2RA (CD25), and that STAT5 induces expression of CD25 in Lin−/Sca-1+/Kit+ NSC (LSK) in C57/Bl6 mice. Correspondingly, expression of CD25 decreased in the human BCR/ABL1+ stem cell line KU812 upon shRNA-induced STAT5-depletion. The BCR/ABL1-inhibitors nilotinib and ponatinib were also found to decrease STAT5 activity and CD25-expression in KU812 cells and primary CML NSC. A CD25-targeting shRNA augmented the proliferation of KU812 cells in vitro and in vivo in NOD/SCID-IL2R-/- mice. In consecutive experiments the PI3K/mTOR-blocker BEZ235 was found to promote STAT5- and CD25 expression and to produce synergistic anti-neoplastic effects with nilotinib and ponatinib in CML cells. Together, CD25 is a novel STAT5-dependent marker and target in CML NSC. Overall design: To define differences in mRNA expression patterns in KU812 cells transduced with a random control shRNA or a shRNA against CD25, gene array analyses were performed.",
